My name is Alexander Piroumian, I would say three words that best describe me are rambunxious, hilarious, and hyped. My favorite hobby would definitely be working on cars, I enjoy making cars fast and racing. I currently only have one pet, which is a cat named Lucy. I do love dogs but am waiting to have a large piece of property that they can run around in.
